# Listening Ear Digital Therapy Room Project

This repository contains both the frontend (React) and backend (C#) code for the Digital Therapy Room project. The frontend code is in the `Codiacs` folder, and the backend code is in the `CodiacsApi` folder - both of these sections have their own README.md files that detail how to run them.

## Cloning the code

You can clone the project using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/nashak01/Codefest2023-Codiacs.git
```
